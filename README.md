Liri application

Week 10 LIRI Project

We used Node JS to create an application similar to SIRI for apple that you can use in your terminal.

The LIRI App has the available commands of:

* my-tweets - to display your last 20 tweets and when they were posted.

* spotify-this-song - shows song data for a song of your choosing.

* movie-this - shows data for a movie of your choosing.

* do-what-it-says - takes text from random.txt and uses it to call one of LIRIs commands.
